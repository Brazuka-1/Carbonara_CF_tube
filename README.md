## Key features:

- High torsion resistance  
- Made with high‑temperature resin. 110 °C short‑term temperature resistance, good for 90 °C chamber.  
- Ultra light, up to 58 % weight reduction from a standard 2020 aluminum extrusion (before hardware and inserts).  
- Smooth 3K carbon strand finish  
- Pre‑drilled, easy installation  
- Unbeatable price/performance  

Tested for 800 hours at VERY high speeds: 500‑1300 mm/s @ 50,000‑100,000 m/s² with 80 °C chamber.

Printer Build Size (mm) | X Gantry Length (mm) | Carbonara Weight (g) | 2020 extrusion Weight (g) | Weight Reduction
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
250 | 330 | 64.7 | 157.1 | 58.8 %  
300 | 380 | 74.5 | 181.0 | -  
350 | 430 | 84.3 | 204.8 | -  

### IMPORTANT!

- The printed inserts are a MUST  to ensure maximum performance. 
- Make sure they are all aligned and facing the same direction.
- The inserts must be a snug fit, not loose.
- Hollow spacers aren't mandatory; they are only used to facilitate installation.
- Inserts must be printed in CF/GF filament with HDT ≥ 110°C, such as annealed PET-CF, PCPBTGF, etc.
- The indented part of the printed inserts is meant to face the linear rail (see image below or consult CAD).
